# DinoRunnerSimulator

This is a game I made as my first attempt at programming by myself :)
The game name is really just a joke title.
Whether you are here from my DeviantArt page or Reddit, please feel free to tell me what you think. If enough people request I will share the source as well for criticism.
P.S. I am a noob when it comes to GitHub so if something is weird, that's probably why. You have to start at some point right?
