# Dino-Runner Simulator

I made this endless runner in Godot to learn gamedev and the Godot game-engine. It was inspired by the so-called "Chrome Dinosaur Game" you can play on the 404 page on Google Chrome. 

## Play the Game

A web build of the game is available on [itch](https://eventhorizontal.itch.io/dinorunnersimulator). 

No native executables are available because I do not yet have a signing certificate to appease the OS malware checker. As such, the only way to get the native build is to export the game yourself. The instructions are listed below.

## Building From Source

To build the game from source, Godot 3 is needed.

1. Clone this repo using
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EventHorizontal/DinoRunnerSimulator.git
```
2. Open Godot 3 and click import project.
3. Select the `project.godot` file in the repository.
4. Download the export templates for your desired platform (if not already installed).
5. Export the project to a binary of the desired platform.
